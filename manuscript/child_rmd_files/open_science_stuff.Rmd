# Open, transparent, and reproducible research \label{app:open_science}

All the code and data necessary to reproduce this work or to evaluate it in
more detail has been made publicly available at Github
(<https://github.com/mark-andrews/BayesianAccountMemoryText>) and at Figshare
(<https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.8246900>). The code consists of R,
RMarkdown, Python, Unix shell scripts, and Jupyter notebooks.  All the data
from behavioural experiments, as well as the data necessary for or created by
the computational simulations are also included. There is approximately 20GB of
files and data in total.  Everything from the creation of the stimuli for the
behavioural experiment, the sample size determination of the experiment, the
creation of the BNC corpus for the topic modelling, the code the topic
modelling, the computational modelling of the alternative (i.e., alternative to
topic modelling) computational models, the post-processing of the computational
models's data, the pre-processing of all the behavioural and other data prior
to the final regression analyses, the final Bayesian regression analyses, as
well as this manuscript with all the tables, figures etc are all reproducible
using the scripts and data in this repository.

The sub-directories of this repository are as follows.

* *data-analysis*: R, Jags, Stan/brms code for Bayesian multilevel logistic regression.
* *data-processing*: Python code for pre-processing experimental data and preparing computational models' predictions for use in the regression analyses.
* *make-corpus*: Mostly Python code for the creation of the BNC corpus to be used in the probabilistic topic modelling.
* *sample-size-determination*: Mostly Python (calling R code) code for determining sample size for the behavioural experiment.
* *stimuli-generation*: Mostly Python code for generating the to-be-memorized texts and the memory word lists in the behavioural experiments.
* *topic-modelling*: Probabilistic topic modelling using the Gustav topic modelling toolbox.
* *manuscript*: The RMarkdown and LaTeX manuscript
