  \caption{a) A schematic representation of the widely held account of text
  memory.  According to this account, we use our background knowledge to
  construct a representation of the text's content, and our recall or
  recognition of words in the text is based on querying this representation. b)
  A Bayesian computational model version of the general account of text memory.
  Background knowledge is knowledge of statistical patterns that represent the
  discourse topics that characterize natural language. The memory
  representation of the text's content is obtained by inferring, using Bayes's
  rule, which discourse topics are inherent in that text. Finally, the recall or recognition of 
  words from the text is based on posterior predictive probability that describes
  which words are and are not typical of topics that were inferred in the text.}
