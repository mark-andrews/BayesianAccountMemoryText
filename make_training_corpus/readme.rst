Jupyter Python notebook to make a topic modelling corpus 
=========================================================

The notebook creates a corpus of short documents from the BNC for use with
probabilistic topic models, particularly using the `Gustav` topic modelling
toolbox.

It requires a Python package called `bnctools` and this will be installed, as will all other requirements, if you do `pip install -r requirements.txt'
